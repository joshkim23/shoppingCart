# shoppingCart

This is another vanilla JS project where I practiced working with objects, arrays, event listeners, loops, and more. 

This is a level 1 shopping cart project. In the future the user will be able to add new grocery items to the groceryList object in the script and the code will autopopulate the information. TBD at a later date
