# shoppingCart

This is another vanilla JS project where I practiced working with objects, arrays, event listeners, loops, and more. 

Key features: 
1. quantity input that populates dynamically with the +/- buttons
2. subtotal per item/overall subtotal/tax/Total cost values that autopopulate

features to complete: 
1. just have an ul in the html file, have the list elements autopopulate using JS only
2. modularize the code so you can add objects and they autopopulate in the shopping cart 
3. have a separate section with various items to select from; items that will autopopulate on the shopping cart
