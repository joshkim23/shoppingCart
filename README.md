# shoppingCart

This is another vanilla JS project where I practiced working with objects, arrays, event listeners, loops, and more. 

Key features: 
1. quantity input that populates dynamically with the +/- buttons
2. subtotal per item/overall subtotal/tax/Total cost values that autopopulate
3. autopopulate list items with quantity input box, +/- buttons and item subtotal from new objects using JS only

Future features to complete: 
1. have a separate section with various items to select from; items that will autopopulate on the shopping cart
